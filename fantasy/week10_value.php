	<h2 class="fantasy-title">Daily Fantasy Value Picks</h2>
	<h3>Week 10 Avg DPP $376 (3-8)</h3>
	<img src="../img/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.jpeg" class="fantasy-pic">
	<h3>Aaron Rodgers</h3>
	<h4>$7,500 Draft Kings (25.12 Pts, $298 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Yes Rodgers is the most expensive QB behind Brady this week, but this is about the Value Per Dollar
			ratio that I use. I had Antonio Brown on this list last week and it worked out pretty good. Rodgers is coming home after
			the toughest 2 game stretch that he will have all year (@DEN, @CAR). This will be a get right situation for Rodgers facing the 18th ranked pass defense and a team that is 29th in fantasy points allowed to QBs. Expect a BIG game from Rodgers as he gets back on track. 
		</p>
	<h3>Jordan Reed</h3>
	<h4>$4,600 Draft Kings (17.9 Pts, $256 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Reed when healthy is almost uncoverable by linebackers. Problem is that he is often injured and 
			has had inconsistent QB play to get him the ball. Reed is healthy and this is a favorable mathcup for him in a home game vs the Saints. NO ranks 30th in pass defense and they are 31st in defending the TE position. All considered Reed is the only 10th highest cost at TE, which to me looks like great value.
		</p>
	<h3 class="loser">Doug Martin</h3>
	<h4>$5,600 Draft Kings (14.3 Pts, $391 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Martin has been hit or miss this season. He loses snaps to Charles Sims if the team is playing from 
			behind, but even if Dallas wins this game. It's hard to imagine that Tampa will need to abandon the run game. This also sets 
			up to be a good matchup for Martin as Dallas is 17th in total rush defense, but 31st in fantasy points allowed to RBs.
		</P>
	<h3 class="loser">Blake Bortles</h3>
	<h4>$5,600 Draft Kings (17.2 Pts, $325 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Bortles has been a pleasant suprise this year and he's only improving. He's coming off of an impressive
			road performance against the Jets, which was NOT a good matchup. He threw for 381 yds and 2 TDs in that matchup, so not too
			shabby. Now he heads on the raod to face the Ravens who sport the 29th ranked total pass defense and are 31st in fanasty points
			allow to QBs. Bortles has an array of weapons, is building confidence, has a good matchup, and is 13th in QB price this week.
			Looks like good value there to me.
		</P>
	<h3 class="loser">Legarrette Blount</h3>
	<h4>$4,900 Draft Kings (15.7 Pts, $312 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">With the injury to Dion Lewis there are going to be extra snaps available in the NE backfield. This 
			is the safe play as it's fairly obvious that Blount will get the bulk of the carries. You could make the play of James White
			or Brandon Bolden as they will take Lewis's spot as the pass cathcer out of the backfield, but that is a much riskier play. 
			The matchup is favorable as the Giants rank 25th in rush defense and 22nd in fantasy points allowed to running backs.
		</P>
	<h3 class="loser">Demaryius Thomas</h3>
	<h4>$7,400 Draft Kings (14.1 Pts, $524 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Thomas has not had an electric season so far, but he has been consistant. This lines up to be a good 
			matchup for Thomas. The Broncos are coming off their first loss of the season, KC ranks 22nd in pass defense, and 32nd in 
			fantasy points allow to WRs. I would expect a solid game from Thomas with a possibility of a huge game since he is due.
		</P>
	<h3 class="loser">DeAngelo Williams</h3>
	<h4>$6,500 Draft Kings (7.9 Pts, $822 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Big Ben looks like he will be a no go here, so what does that mean?? Means the Steelers will rely 
			heavily on their running game against the 32nd ranked rush defense in the NFL. Williams has had solid days in all 3 his starts
			17.2, 31.2, and 41.5. And he is not the cheapest option, but could be in line for a BIG day.
		</P>
	<h3 class="loser">Allen Robinson</h3>
	<h4>$6,700 Draft Kings (16.1 Pts, $416 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">This pick could go to Allen Hurns as well, while he's a little cheaper and has scored a TD in 6 straight
			games. I like Robinson a little better because he is a better deep threat and Baltimore is vulnerable over the top. The Ravens
			are 31st in points allowed to WRs and 29th in total pass defense. So take your pick, but I'm riding with Robinson.
		</P>
	<h3 class="loser">James Starks</h3>
	<h4>$4,900 Draft Kings (15.6 Pts, $314 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Starks has been the best running back in the Packers backfield ALL year. Now that he is the starter then 
			there is more comfort in his touch count. Lacy is ruled out this week, and Detroit has the 30th ranked rushing defense. I'm expecting
			 a big day out of the Packers offense and Starks should benefit and at a valued cost.
		</P>
	<h3 class="loser">James White</h3>
	<h4>$3,000 Draft Kings (2.1 Pts, $1428 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">If you're looking for a big upside for a low price, then White is the guy. I beleive Blount is the safer
			play here, but there isn't much risk with only a $3,000 price. White may not get the carries, but he is expected to replace Dion 
			Lewis on passing downs. Brady loves hitting up RB out of the backfield, so I will chance it for the price.
		</P>
	<h3>Chris Givens</h3>
	<h4>$3,200 Draft Kings (13.7 Pts, $233 DPP)</h4>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Givens will start due to the injury to Steve Smith. He will be the deep threat in the offense, and 
			could fit with Flaco's big are. The Jags are ranked 25th in pass defense and he could have a somewhat productive day at home. Don't 
			expect a huge day, but isn't a bad option for the price.
		</P>
	<h2 class="fantasy-title">What is DPP??</h2>
		<p class="fantasy-body">Dollar Per Point, is a metric of measuring how much value you get out of a certain player. How many
			Dollars you spent on that player's salary Per Point he actually scored for you. Obviously you can't fill your team with a 
			bunch of Julio Jones for $9,000 a piece, and at the same time if Julio Jones has a bad matchup that week then he isn't 
			going to get you value on your investment. So I try to pick out players regardless of salary cost that will give you a good
			return on your investment. 
		</p>
		<p class="fantasy-body">So what is a good DPP?? Depends on what you play. If you play tournaments then you are basically shooting
			in the dark and I can't really help you. The best way to keep your money alive in DFS is to play double-ups. No you're not going
			to win a million dollars, but if you play it right then you can actually make money or at least not make a new deposit every few
			weeks. Now on a $50,000 roster it will fluctuate what puts you in the money if you're playing a double-up. Usually if you score 
			150 fantasy points it will put you in the money. So if your team averages a DPP of $333.33 that will put you at 150 points. Your 
			defense on the other hand doesn't score with much value, so we will need to average a little better than $333 with the rest of our
			team. So to be safe lets try to average $300 or lower because a lower DPP is obviously better. Every week I will try to bring you 
			a set of guys that give you a DPP of $300 or under. Good Luck!
