	<h3 class="my-picks">Indiana +3</h3>
	<p class="picks-talk">Maryland(2-8) comes in losers of 7 straight while Indiana(4-6) comes in losers of 6 straight. What we
	  do know is that someone's streak has to come to an end. Indiana has the worst pass defense in the nation, but Maryland's 
	  passing game is... well it's inept to put it nicely. I just don't see Maryland being able to exploit Indiana's secondary 
	  enough to get the victory. As bad as Indiana is on defense they are actually a capable offense. Indiana pushed Michigan 
	  to double OT last week and Jordan Howard ran for 238 yards against the Wolverine's stingy rush defense. Even though Indiana
	  has lost 6 straight they have been competative in many of those games and I think they are playing better football. I'll 
	  take them to win this game outright. 
	</p>
	<h3 class="loser">Penn State +3.5</h3>
	<p class="picks-talk">This sets up to be a dangerous game for Michigan(8-2). With the showdown next week against Ohio State
	  you wonder how focused they will be this weekend. The Wolverines travel to Beaver Stadium to take on Penn State(7-3) in what arguably will be their most difficult road game of the year. Penn State has won all 7 home games this year and looks to make it 8. Both teams play very good defense as Michigan ranks in the top 10 in both pass and rush defense, and 
	  Penn State ranks 2nd in the nation in pass defense and 48th in rush defense. This should be a tight game and could go either way. Michigan is the better team, but I think the homefield advantage and the Ohio State game looming can keep Penn
	  State within a FG and possibly the chance to pull off the upset. 
	</p>
	<h3 class="loser">Illinois +5</h3>
	<p class="picks-talk">Illinois(5-5) and Minnesota(4-6) both come into the final 2 weeks of the season looking to get bowl
	 eligible. The Gophers have lost 4 straight, and although they have been close they are still 1 loss away from missing out on 
	 going bowling. Illinois lost 3 straight while Josh Ferguson was out with an injury, but they are a different team with him in the lineup. This should be a close game as the 2 teams battle it out to get bowl eligible, but with Fergurson healthy and the best player on the field I like the Illini to cover here.
	</p>
	<h3 class="my-picks">Nevada +15</h3>
	<p class="picks-talk">Nevada(6-4) comes in winners of 4/5 while Utah State(5-5) comes in losers of 3/4. Utah State may be the
	 more talented team here, but Nevada is playing better football. Utah State is better on the defensive side of the ball ranking 14th in total pass defense and 57th in total rush defense, where Nevada ranks 77th in rushing defense and 71st in passing defense. With Nevada getting over 2 TDs here I just have a lot of confidence in them to cover that. Nevada has a balanced rushing attack with 2 guys approaching 1,000 yards with J.Butler(997) and D.Jackson(897). While Utah State plays solid pass defense their rush defene is very average. Nevada runs the ball well enough to keep the chains moving and keep the game close. Give me the Wolfpack and the points.

	<h3 class="loser">Wisconsin -10</h3>
	<p class="picks-talk">Northwestern(8-2) travels to Camp Randall to take on Wisconsin(8-2), and let me just start with the fact
		that I am notorious for riding the Wildcats. Problem is that the more that I tried to convince myself to take Northwestern today then the more I liked the Badgers. Here's why... Clayton Thorson is a big talent no doubt, but he hasn't progressed much as a passer as he's thrown for a measly 1259 yards and a 6/6 TD/INT ratio. Northwestern's inability to pass attributed
		to both their losses as both their losses came at the hands of teams with top 10 rushing defenses Michigan(7) and Iowa(8). Not only were they losses, but they were blowouts as the Michigan game was 38-0 and the Iowa game was 40-10. So what's Wisconsin's rush defense ranked??? Glad you asked because it's ranked 4th. So a road game at Camp Randall against the 4th ranked rushing defense and it looks like a disaster for the Northwestern offense... like I wouldn't be suprised at all if they got shutout. Wisconsin may not score much, but they won't need to, so I'm taking the home team to cover.

	<h3 class="my-picks">Pitt -1</h3>
	<p class="picks-talk">Pitt(7-3) is coming off of their biggest win of the year a 31-13 victory over Duke, and Louisville(6-4) 
		comes in winners of 4 straight. Louisville's rush defense ranks 10th overall and their pass defesne ranks 41st, while Pitt's
		rush defense ranks 37th and their pass defense ranks 38th. So defensively these are 2 sound teams with the slight edge going to Louisville and that stingy run defense. Both these teams are below average offensively with a slight edge to Lousville here as well. So why am I picking Pitt?? Well with no large advantage in any area I'm leaning on homefield advantage. Louisville is negative in the turnover margin and that doesn't travel well against a solid defense on the road. And lastly Tyler Boyd will make some plays in a close game to give Pitt the win at home. 
	</p>
	<h3 class="my-picks">Miss State +5</h3>
	<p class="picks-talk">Arkansas(6-4) comes in red hot winners of 4 straight and playing the best football in the SEC aside 
		from Bama. Miss St(7-3) comes in winners 4 of their last 5, and that loss came last week to Bama where they got dominated 
		on their home field. The Razorback are balanced offensively led by senior QB Brandon Allen who is playing the best ball of 
		his career. The Bulldogs on the other hand are one dimensional offensively as Dak Prescott is their entire offense. Now although I think think Arkansas is the better team and will probably win. I do like MSU to cover for 1 main reason and that is that the Razorbacks rank 115th in total pass defense. Prescott is the best QB in the SEC and he should exploit the weak pass defense of Arkansas. The Razorbacks will move the ball, but I think Prescott can keep it close. As a side note MSU has won 3 straight in the series, so give me the points. 
	</p>
  <h3 class="loser">Oklahoma State -1</h3> 
	<p class="picks-talk">Baylor(8-1) travels to Stillwater to faceoff against the undefeated Cowboys(10-0). Baylor hasn't won in
	  Stillwater since 1939 and have gone 0-10 there during the Big 12 era. It doesn't look good for them this year either. There has been a noticable drop off with Jarrett Stidham filling in for Seth Russell. Stidham doesn't pose as the running threat that Russell did, so I just don't have confidence in Stidham to do something that no other Baylor QB has been able to do in 
	  Stillwater since 1939.... WIN!!
