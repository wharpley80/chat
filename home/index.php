	<p class="home-body">Now I took the liberty last week of blasting the SEC, which was a complete and total pleasure let me 
		tell you. Alabama has been the most consistant powerhouse in College Football over the past 6 years. And while the SEC had been the best conference in football for a good 6 or 7 years, that reign at the top has come to an end. Over the last 3 years the SEC for the most part has just been ridding the coattails of Alabama. It is obvious to anyone who watches CFB
		with exception to SEC fans who are still living in the past or just take everything ESPN($2+ billion partner with SEC) says as the truth. 
  </p>
  <p class="home-body">Moving on... the Big 12 and fans of schools in the conference feel that they are getting snubbed by the 
  	Playoff Committee. Well I'm here to tell you that you ARE NOT being treated as equals, but I'm also here to tell you that for the most part it's with good reason. So being the equal opportunist that I am. I found this as good a time as any to explain why. 
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">First lets start with talent. I know that I for one when watching a Big 12 game, while I find it 
		entertaining I can't help but notice that the quality of actual FOOTBALL being played is very low. It is very similar to watching the American Athletic Conference or the MAC. The defense is almost non-existant and the play in the trenches is not at the level of a Power Conference. Now Big 12 fans or people on the payroll of the Big 12(Joel Klatt) will tell you that its just the style of play and they just have better players at the skilled positions, but many NFL analysts talk about the Big 12 not producing NFL talent. 
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">Scouts do a great job of evaluating potential and talent, but we as CFB fans know that potential doesn't 
		make you a good football player. If you follow recruiting then you know that every year you'll get excited about a 4* or 5* recruit and then a few years later you ask what ever happened to that guy?? Well the NFL is the same way. Scouts evaluate what a player does at college and at the NFL combine and then draft the player accordingly. So I asked myself, what is the actual "truth serum"? I mean in college most games are played against either lower opponents or conference opponents. If a guy is a 3 year starter then he may have what 4-5 games played against quality opponents outside of his conference in that 3 years. So the largest sample size NFL scouts will have is how a player performs against other teams inside his own conference. 
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">On to the "truth serum". The end all be all of how talented these guys actually are is not who makes it 
		to the NFl, but who is a starter in the NFL. Scouts and GMs miss on guys all the time, so just because you're drafted does not mean that you're a NFL quality player. Many guys get drafted high and never even see time as a starter, so the "truth serum" is not who gets drafted to the NFL, but who actually starts in the NFL. If you can think of a more concrete theory that makes more sense than that then I'm all ears. So here is a list of the so called Power 5 conferences and how many players from those conferences are actually starting in the NFL. 
	</p>
	<div class="nfl-star">
		<h3>NFL Starters by Conf</h3>
		<ol class="nfl-list">
			<li>SEC - 139 - (9.9)</li>
			<li>ACC - 125 - (8.9)</li>
			<li>Big 10 - 108 - (7.7)</li>
			<li>PAC 12 - 101 - (8.4)</li>
			<li>Big 12 - 50 - (5)</li>
			<li>FCS - 76</li>
		</ol>
	</div>	
	<p class="home-body">Now before people from the Big 12 start pointing out the obvious flaw with this, which is that there are
    more teams in some conferences than others. Well good thing I already thought about that. The number in the parenthesis is the average based upon the total players and the actual number of teams in the conference. So a couple of things should jump out at you. 
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">First is that obviously the Big 12 is at the bottom of the Power 5 in terms of total number of players 
		and average players per team. And not only are they at the bottom, they are signifigantly at the bottom. I mean there are actually more players from the FCS(Bowl Sub Division) starting in the NFL than there are from the Big 12. That's not the case with any other conference, and the arguement that there are fewer teams doesn't help you. Even if you added 4 more teams to the conference then at (5) per team that would still only put you at 70, which is still fewer than the FCS.  
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">The next thing that should jump out at you is that the SEC is at the top.... but not by much. During the 
		stretch of 7 years where the SEC was so called DOMINANT over College Football, and that the SEC had players that were just in a different class. Well they did produce more NFL talent, but aren't you just a little suprised that if everything they were selling us was true that they would have double or triple the players starting in the NFL???? Yeah I was too. I guess that if you compare the SEC to the Big 12 then there is deffinatly a signifigant difference, but it's safe to say that the other 4 conferences are playing with similar parts. 
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">Based off of this data I'm going to just state that there is not the quality of talent in the Big 12 
		that there is in the other Power 5 Conferences. You can argue all that you want, but just make sure that you have an arguement that holds water. So onto the next reason to why in the end the Big 12 will get snubbed, which is that there is
		no Conference Title game. Who is there to blame for that?? Texas!!!
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">This starts back in 2004. There was 3 years left on the existing contract between ESPN and the Big 10.
	  The Big 10 tried negotiating for a signifigant increase in rights fees. ESPN turned them down, so the Big 10 started searching elsewhere. They came to terms with Fox Entertainment Group which was the beginning of the Big 10 Network. This basically revolutionalized collge sports. It would pay every team in the conference equally from the bottom all the way to the top, while also generating more revenue for each team in the conference than ever before. The Big 10 Network launched in 2007 and the revenue per team has increased every year since it's beginning.
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">On to the Big 12. With the success of the Big 10 Network you'd assume that other conferences would 
		follow in creating their own Conference Network. Well Texas had a different idea. Instead of creating a Big 12 Network, Texas instead partnered with ESPN to create the Longhorn Network. While at the time it was a great finacial play for Texas. It literally killed the Big 12 Conference as we knew it. The LHN only generates revenue for Texas giving them a financial edge over every other team in the conference. Texas is also tied to the LHN for 20 years, so if the Big 12 did create a network then Texas could not participate in Big 12 Network airing until around 2030.
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">This really ruined relations between Texas and other teams in the Big 12, which led to the departures of 
		Nebraska, Texas A&M, Missouri, and Colorado. All these schools left to join other conferences all of whom have revenue sharing deals for each school. So without enough teams the Big 12 is left with no Conference Title game, and I don't care what you're being told by the Playoff Committee. Having no conference title game hurts you... BIG TIME. There is something about a Conference Title game that just feels special, and when you give these other conferences 1 last chance to leave a mark on the Committee. And you're sitting at home while the other 4 teams in the Power 5 are having a Conference Title game then no matter what they're telling you... you're screwed. And you can't blame the SEC, Big 10, ACC, or the PAC 12. Just look in your own conference and thank the people wearing the Burnt Orange..."Bite off your Nose Despite your Face".
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">The Big 12 tried adding 1 more Conference game and then you got Big 12 representatives bragging about
	  playing 1 more Power 5 opponent than other Conferences. Well since we already established the lack of talent in the Big 12, then when you go and brag about playing 1 more Conference opponent I can't help but laugh. Bragging about playing 1 more Big 12 team is like bragging about being the smartest retard. I just sit back and hear some of the stupid things these guys say on the Networks and whenever it doesn't add up then all you have to do is follow the paper trail. ESPN's journalistic integrity is flawed by their colossal contracts with the SEC and Texas. Just think when was the last time that you heard ESPN talk negatively about any of those schools. They have to protect their investment and same goes with Fox and the Big 12 and PAC 12. So believe what you want, but if you want to be an educated fan then do the research and maybe you'll see the light.
