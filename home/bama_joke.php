	<p class="home-body">That's right you read the title correctly. A 1 loss Bama team has no damn bussiness being above an undefeated
		Oklahoma State, Iowa, and especially not Ohio State. This is an insult to a knowledgable college football fan. We are near the end
		of the season and a 1 loss SEC team is ranked higher in the CFB Playoff Rankings than 3 other undefeated teams from power 5
		conferences. So why do we play the games?? I get that there is no reason to panic because everything will work it's way out by the
		end of November. That may be true, but why is Bama ranked #2 then?? If everything will work it's way out then why doesn't 1 loss
		Bama sit back at #4 or #5 where they belong? They have done nothing to deserve being ranked higher than those other 3 schools. 
  </p>
  <p class="home-body">Bottom line is that it's all about ESPN's deal with the SEC which is worth over $2 billion. That's right for
  	you misguided who take ESPN as the gospel then look it up. ESPN has a TV deal for 15 years and over $2 billion with the SEC. Sure 
  	they have deals with other conferences as well, but none come close to the deal that created the SEC Network. They are fully invested
  	in the SEC and do everythinig in their power to boost their investment. ESPN for the most part owns CFB. If you doubt it then count how
  	many games are aired throughout the week on ESPN or ABC versus every other network combined. So what'd you come up with about 20-10? 
  	Depending on the week it can change, but that's about the right ratio. So ESPN's influence through either media or $$ is HUGE on the 
  	college football landscape. Still don't understand??
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">Let me break down Bama and who they've played. We will start with out of conference. They played UL Monroe (1-9),
		Middle Tennessee (5-5), and #21 Wisconsin (8-2). The first 2 listed are nothing to brag about, but Wisconsin is a formidable opponent.
		The problem is that they played at a neutral site, against a new coach in his first game coached at Wisconsin, Wisconsin lost it's best
		defensive player and captain (Michael Caputo) on the 3rd play of the game to a head injury, and their best offensive player (Corey Clement)
		left in the first half with a groin injury. Now a convincing win over Wisconsin is a nice victory, but all things considered it was no 
		statement win by any means. Then you look at the fact that Wisconsin hasn't beaten a team with a winning record all year and it deffinately
		isn't a HUGE win. Oh and Bama's last OOC game is this weekend against Charleston Southern. Nothing like a nice little FCS school on the 
		schedule in late November right before Rivalry Week, HAHA!
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">Alright, so you say that they play such a difficult schedule with the SEC. I guess if you're a moron that lives in the 
		south and doesn't realize that there is football being played around the country outside the SEC, then that would sound very believable to 
		you. Unfortunately the rest of us have a brain and can come to the conclusion that the SEC is another good conference and nothing else. So the only reason 
		that Bama has a difficult schedule is because SEC teams are ALL over hyped and over ranked. Don't believe me?? Fine, so Bama is (6-1) in 
		conference. Now of those 7 teams they've played. Those 7 teams have played 26 OOC games. Of those 26 OOC games only 4 have been against
		teams from a Power 5 conference. Now in those 4 games the SEC is 2-2. Those 2 wins came against Arizona State (5-5) and Syracuse (3-7). So 
		we are 10 games into the season and none of the 7 SEC teams that Bama has played even has a victory over a ranked team from a Power 5 conference
		or even a team with a winning record from a Power 5 conference for that matter. Then to drive it home. The second best team in the SEC west
	  who just drugg LSU @ Death Valley is Arkansas. Now look at Arkansas's schedule because they lost to TOLEDO and TEXAS TECH who is probably the
	  worst defensive team in all of CFB. They're beating up on the SEC yet they couldn't manage victories over Toldeo and Texas Tech... wow.
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">So tell me again how big and bad the SEC really is... I'm waiting because I'd love for you to explain it to me. You'll probably
		want to tell me about all the BCS titles that the SEC won and especially the one where they played against each other (LSU/BAMA) in what is the 
		biggest disgrace of a title game in the history of any sport. Now if the past is relevant then lets talk about the immediate past like last year
		where Bama lost in the Sugar Bowl to Ohio State. Where Ohio State was faster and more athletic and ran the ball down the throat of Bama for 281
		yards. The same Ohio State team that returned every key player from a year ago, is 10-0 (1 fewer loss than Bama), and yet is behind Bama in the 
		CFB Playoff Rankings. To make an even bigger joke they were ranked behind LSU in the first poll because they were the only undefeated SEC team. 
	</p>
	<p class="home-body">In conclusion I'm not making the arguement that Oklahoma State, Iowa, or Ohio State have amazing OOC victories because they
		don't. And I'm not saying that Bama is horrible because they are obviously a talented team. And I'm not saying that the SEC is a weak conference 
		because they aren't. My points which I have provided sufficent evidence for is that a 1 loss Bama team has no bussiness being ahead of those other 
		undefeated teams this late in the season. There is no legitimate arguement because all they have done is beaten a bunch of over ranked SEC teams 
		that haven't beaten anyone but eachother. Quit drinking the Kool-Aid man!! And by the way, Bama's loss is a bad one. A home loss to a 3 loss Ole 
		Miss team. Ole Miss is a perenial SEC bottom dweller for years. You only think they're relevant becasue they've beaten Bama 2 years in a row. So 
		bump Bama back to 5 or 6 where they BELONG, and let the chip fall where they may.
